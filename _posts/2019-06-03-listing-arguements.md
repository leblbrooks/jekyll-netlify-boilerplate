Key People-

Nita Farahany, Lee M. Silver

Nita Farahany-

"The enhancement vs therapy distinction is really just a red herring. So if I improve somebody's health have I enhanced them? The truth is every improvement we have had in our health over the past century and more has been an enhancement. So do parents want to enhance their childrenm of course they do. They give them better education. They give them Prenatal vitiamins. They do prenatal yoga and every other type of thing to try to makes things better. They take headphones and play music for their children during the gestational period. Do parents want to enhance their children? Yes. Do they already do it? Yes. Should genetic engineering that enhances their health be permitted to go forward. Yes."

Lee Silver-

"We dont stop people who are both carriers with the same mutation at reproducing even though they have a 25% of having a child with a serious disease, we shouldnâ€™t discriminate against people just because they are infertile."

Nita Farahany-

"When I am ready to have children I hope that I also have the option of having a healthy child with whatever the best technology is that we have available to us today.
I urge you to vote in favor of scientific progress. To enable each of us as private citizens to make private choices in the most intimate choice we will ever make in life, to bring healthy children into this world."

Nita Farahany-

"The idea of if there is uncertainty we should not proceed, well I have news for you, every single time we choose to reporducte there is uncertainty. We have no idea how this unique combination of indiuatals will result. We certainly are not going to say we are going to ban natural reproduction, which is no more sex or no more kids.
Instead we are going to ensure the scientific safety and efficacy of technologies before we proceed."

Nita Farahany-

"I want to draw your attention to the resolution this evening, it calls for an outright and complete ban on genetic engineering of babies. If Lee and I can convince you of any instance in which genetic engineering of babies is legitimate, then you should vote against the resolution. I will defend that genetic engineering is no different in kind than the many ways we already engineer our children. From the partner we choose, to prenatal screening, to the supplements that we take that impact our children and their fates."
