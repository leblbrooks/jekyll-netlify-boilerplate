US Births are the lowest they have been in 32 years.
Here is a link to an article from [npr.](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/15/723518379/u-s-births-fell-to-a-32-year-low-in-2018-cdc-says-birthrate-is-at-record-level)

And another article on [Zerohedge.](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-05-31/baby-bust-millennial-brith-rates-plunges-three-decade-low)

The fertility rate in the US has been under the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman since 2008. The number of births in the US have fallen for the past 10 years.

One factor cited by the CDC as a reason for the decline is that mroe women are delaying childbirth to attend college and have careers.

What does this mean? Women on average are getting married later and when you get married later you tend to have fewer children.

I think one of the most interesting questions to ask is, of all the women that pursue their education and career at the expense of finding a partner and starting a family, do they regret that decision.

Most women think that it is wise to pursue an advanced education and a career for the sake of independence. Society reinforces the idea of delaying finding a life partner, without fully weighing the pros and cons of each path.

Culturally, women are constantly told they can have it all without bringing to light any of the real negatives that exist to delaying this very important aspect of their lives.

The question I like to ask is, are women happy with this choice? And are they believing things that are not true, which are preventing them from making better decisions in their personal life?
