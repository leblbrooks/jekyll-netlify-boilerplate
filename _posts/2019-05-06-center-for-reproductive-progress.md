The Center for Reproductive Progess- Notes on future for-profit think tank.

Human embryo genetic engineering is a complex and highly controversial technology. Currently, the mainstream arguements against the use of this technology have been heavily one-sided in that they focus predominatly on the cons, are biased, and most importantly are using a faulty standard of value by which to measure whether the use of technology is good or bad.

This is an organization that aims to add to the discussion by looking at all the arguements in a larger pro human context.
The goal is to provide a source for real knowledge by evaluating all claims surrounding this technology, helping bring us closer to the truth.

Because the ultimate goal is to be able to think clearly about this topic, understand the full context in order to aid us in making the best policy decsions regarding use of this technology for human flourishing, or for humans to live at their highest level or greatest potential.
